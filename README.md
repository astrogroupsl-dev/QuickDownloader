# Quick Downloader - Command Line Based GUI Tool

## Introduction

Welcome to the Quick Downloader repository! This Python-based tool is designed to make downloading large files a breeze. By splitting the download into multiple parts and downloading them concurrently, it aims to significantly reduce the total download time.

The project utilizes Python's threading capabilities to achieve concurrent downloads, and the `requests` library for handling HTTP requests.

Whether you're dealing with large datasets, high-resolution media files, or just want to boost your download speed, the QuickDownloader is here to help. We hope you find it useful!

We appreciate your interest in QuickDownloader and look forward to your feedback as we work towards a stable release. Thank you for testing this pre-release version!
